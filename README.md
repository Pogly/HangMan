Hangman Game
This Python script is an implementation of the classic game of Hangman. The player guesses letters to reveal a randomly chosen word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before they lose.

Overview
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list. The player then attempts to guess letters in the word, with feedback provided for each guess. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions. If not, the player loses a life. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses all letters in the word or runs out of lives.
